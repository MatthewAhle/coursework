# Homeworld Music for FTL!

Dropbox link for download:  https://www.dropbox.com/s/aliiufv50pii22m/resource.dat?dl=0

This is a mod I made for the popular indie game, FTL: Faster Than Light.  It replaces all of the original music files by Ben Prunty (who is amazing, I mean no disrespect by this!) with the soundtrack from the original Homeworld game, published by Sierra Entertainment in 1999.

All rights owned by someone else.  I don't profit from this, this was purely an exercise in learning some new skills (XML editing and Python) and honoring two games I love!

To install: download the provided file, resource.dat.  Navigate to your game's resources folder (for example, in my case it's located at C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/Steamapps/common/FTL Faster Than Light/resources/.

BACK UP YOUR ORIGINAL RESOURCE.DAT FILE!  Replace the original resource.dat with the one I provided, keeping your original backed up in a safe location.

Enjoy!
